Which method you implemented to set the timer and why?

I have used JavaScript Date() Method to calculate the exact time lapsed rather than deppendent on interval/setTimeout. 

Because we can't trust on interval/setTimeout, while time accuracy is concerned.

What engineering considerations drove your solution



*enhance feature:
 
 store last paused times
 make dark/light theme option
 Makesure running in all different browser
 make animation more smoother e.g using animation as linear or bezier
